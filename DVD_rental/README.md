### Project Title
Investigate a DVD rental database

### Description
In this project, we will use PostgreSQL to explore a database that holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. We will query the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as the patterns in movie watching across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

### Getting Started
To run the queries on our local machine, we need to follow the steps below:
1. Install a new database system, PostgreSQL
2. Load the database in your local PostgreSQL database server

### What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system. Object-relational databases use a hybrid approach to databases.Importantly, PostgreSQL allows the use of advanced functions (such as Window Functions), and even development and use of custom functions written in different programming languages.

### Installing

Click on the "Download DVD Rental Sample Database" button and extract the dvdrental.tar.file.
#### Load database
The next step is to load the DVD Rental database into your PostgreSQL server on your machine using PgAdmin tool. Follow the instructions under the header "Load the DVD Rental database using pgAdmin tool" in the link:http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/load-postgresql-sample-database/
